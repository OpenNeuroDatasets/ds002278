DIVA (Dense Investigation of Variability of Affect) was a pilot study acquired at Florida International University in early 2020.
DIVA involves a large amount of neuroimaging, neuropsychological, demographic, and physiological data for a small sample of ~3 participants.

Data collection was stopped early due to COVID.
