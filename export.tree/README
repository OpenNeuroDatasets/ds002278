# Dense Investigation of Variability of Affect

Dense Investigation of Variability of Affect (DIVA) was a pilot study acquired at Florida International University in early 2020.
DIVA involves a large amount of neuroimaging, neuropsychological, demographic, and physiological data for a small sample of ~3 participants.

Data collection was stopped early due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Data Availability

The current OpenNeuro DIVA dataset includes imaging, physiological, and in-scanner task data.
Additional, possibly sensitive data, such as hormone measures and questionnaire answers, are currently being reviewed and will likely be shared within a data use agreement framework in the future.

## Notes on Data Quality

sub-PILOT_ses-01_task-localizerDetection_run-1, sub-PILOT_ses-01_task-localizerDetection_run-1, and sub-PILOT_ses-01_task-strangerthings_run-1 were run without audio.
